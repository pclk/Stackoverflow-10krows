I used linear regression and Random Forest regressor on a dataset with 30 features to make predictions.

Except for 2 features others exhibit a correlation coefficient greater than 0.65 with the target variable. I further used RFE to identify the best 'n' number of features. A subset of 7 features gave the highest r2 score. However, the issue is as the features are all vegetation indices used for crop health monitoring, they are correlated to one another giving rise to multicollinearity.What I would now like to do is filter these 30 features and select the most useful ones (e.g. top 5 or top 10) in predicting the target variable.

To my surprise, almost half of the libraries did not survive the install run of my cmd.
I decided, that wxpython is more important to me than pywin32, so I roled back the whole process again, assuming, the libraries under 64 will be intact afterwards. Heck, they aren't. The same half of librariesthat I had after 32bit, where then usable when reinstalling 64bit.How do I get to a stage, where I can install a fresh and clean 64 bit environment again?I used the windows installer just because of the option to be able to deinstall clean (like not only the directories, but also possible registry keys and so forth) but to no avail.Later, after all this, I learned, that there is a cache dir of the libraries in the users directory.

On the PC where I coded it everything works perfectly but now I tried to run the script on a VPS but I'm getting errors from the Bot.I thought that this must be related to the different configuration of the two machines, I copied the requirements.txt from the 1st machine and installed the same python packages on the VPS but I got same error.I'm running Python 3.10.4 on bot machines and using Visual Studio Code as editor/terminal.The error that I get (which basically stucks the entire bot) is this: ""Error fetching tokens transferred: string indices must be integers""Given the fact that the codes is exactly the same on both machines, I guess that on the first one I have some library/package that handles integers in a different way?Can't get my head around this!

I'm working on a reinforcement learning project using PyTorch, where an agent is trained to play a custom game. However, I've encountered an issue where the agent shows no signs of improvement over time. I've implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model for the agent's learning process.The game:The agent selects a move between 1-15If the move is valid, then the agent gets a reward of 0if the move is invalid then it gets a reward of -1after selecting 45 valid moves, the game ends, the agent receives a reward based on which valid moves it pickedI implemented a DQN model to try and solve this simple game, but after running it for over 80 iterations, the DQN model shows no improvement.What I've noticed is that after about 3 iterations, the DQN model starts making the exact same actions over and over, it picks 2 or 3 of the 15 actions and only uses those for the rest of the training. For example, it might pick action 5 and action 12 and switch back and forth between those actions for the rest of the training, this is a problem because after a move has been picked, the action becomes invalid for the rest of the round, so that agent just picks invalid actions over and over. here is an example of what actions it is taking:tensor([6728., 7771., 6208., 3454., 2145., 7752., 8582., 3225.,    0., 1219.,

This might be a vague question, but I failed to rephrase it properly. So here's an explanation.I developed an app that was originally developed as a Mac application, using API's from both Carbon/Cocoa to achieve my task. (The goal of the application is to send 'keystrokes' to an app after mouse movements / other keystrokes. I use Accessibility API's for that).But now, I want to add scripting support, so there can be conditional keystrokes. Such as: after 5 times of pressing 'Y', I want to press the button 'B'.Within OSX, there's no possibility for a Python app to do such a thing, and I can't find any libraries that allow me to do it. So I figured I'd make the app two-fold. First: I'll write an app in Cocoa/Carbon with the basic functions: SendKeyToApp(pid,key) and WaitForMovement().The python app will communicate with that app, using those method calls. The question here is: how do I communicate between those two apps? Will I use a HTTP Server, a Socket Server, some kind of subprocess.Popen() hacks. I frankly have no idea.Does anyone have any ideas to achieve such a task?",0

I am supposed to grade this assignment for a professor in an introductory computer science class, but I think I am either misinterpreting the assignment or it is kind of a poorly designed problem. Here are the three parts:Suppose that the cover price of a book is 24.95 dollars, however bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs 3 dollars for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. Write a functionwholesale(n)that returns the total wholesale cost for an order of n books.Write a second wholesale function for a different book that costs 22.95 dollars, has the same discount, but that ships for 3 dollars for the first copy and 85 cents for each additional copy. Call this function wholesale2.Functions are actually objects themselves, and they have a type. As a result you can pass functions to other functions. Write a functioncheck_cost(p, p2, n)that takes functionspandp2and an integern, and returns a Boolean value True if p(n) > p2(n); and False otherwise. Apply it to your wholesale functions by calling:check_cost(wholesale, wholesale2, n)and use different values for n until you find where the order of the costs changes.In theory this is a pretty basic concept, however the two functions that I have written crossover at zero (and in this context we should only need to consider positive integers), and I feel like this defeats the point of the assignment especially in the context, where one should be cheaper for some number of books, but if you buy in bulk ultimately the other should be cheaper - at least that is what I was expecting.Here is my chunk of code:The final statement is just what I was using to determine the crossover, after I realized that it is not at a positive integer point, which again I feel defeats the point of the problem. Have I misinterpreted the question and incorrectly written the two functions? Or is it a poorly designed problem? Additionally, thecheck_costfunction seems poorly designed by the nature he wants, as I feel as if there is no reason to pass the parameternif we just need to compare the values of the two functions atn.Please let me know if I am simply overlooking something.

All other corners show some best-fitting to mitigate the sharp angle.Does anyone know how to make sure the start/end points are also considered in this best-fit tangency fitting?Example:Below is the method used to create the X/Y points. It takes a numpy-2D-array as an input.EDIT 1 - For background reference:I'm trying to fit a b-spline to a set of unordered points from a point cloud.

I'm working on a big model that inputs a list of parameters and outputs scalars and numpy arrays.
These arrays all have the same length (~50,000) and represent scalar fields.
My goal is to try different inputs and compare the outputs. I want the final product to be a big Dataframe with all my data. I want to be able to serialize it, and I want to produce graphs out of it.What is the best way to represent the output using pandas objects?I already have 2 ideas but don't know which one is best.One way would be for my model to return a Series object created from the dictionary of the outputs. Each line of my big final Dataframe would be one of these Series. Some of the columns of that Dataframe would have a big numpy array in each cell. Here is what the big final Dataframe would look like:InputScalar output 1Scalar output 2Array output 1Array output 2150.2np.ndarray(size=50000)np.ndarray(size=50000)2-55.8np.ndarray(size=50000)np.ndarray(size=50000)3184np.ndarray(size=50000)np.ndarray(size=50000)Alternatively, my model would return a Dataframe of 50000 lines. The scalar outputs would get repeated over all the lines, and the big arrays would turn into the columns. The big final Dataframe would just be the concatenation of these:InputScalar output 1Scalar output 2Array indexArray output 1Array output 2150.202.36150.2112315..................150.2500000.252-55.801348..................2-55.85000098-5",0

But if I make even a single http request any future sending of SIGTERM is shown on the screenbut the script doesn't shut down.I was convinced at first this was my mistake somehow, that I wasn't exiting properly from my requests, but it turns out even a 404 request, or a 405, trigger the same behaviour.If I run this, then send SIGTERM, no problem, script exists. If I request a page and get a 404, that's it, no more response to SIGTERM except the message saying it got the signal, but it doesn't shut down after that.The host and port don't make any difference. Nor does adding successful requests. The only thing that seems to trigger the behaviour is theline.

I have an exception class I created that I find extremely handy when dealing with multiple errors, and I would like to improve it.  I call it.BackgroundBasically, it buffers exception objects.  (The code that uses it is left to deal with addressing cascading errors so that the script can otherwise proceed, e.g. skip a row of input data).  I wrote it because we have a scientific data submission interface and the data is always prone to many user errors (improper formatting, data conflicts, missing data, and a whole host of data-specific issues).  The loading script takes a long time to run, and to have to restart the load after encountering individual errors can be a weeks long process.  With myclass, all errors and warnings are buffered, and eventually summarized at the end of the run.  We have a data validation interface that re-uses the same loading code and provides the error summary to the researcher for them to be able to fix issues on their own and then attempt to revalidate.The Original ProblemSince the exceptions are raised later, you don't get a trace of where the exception was caught and buffered.Mitigation of the original problemI mitigated this issue by utilizingand then appending.  (I prune the stack by excluding anything with ""site-packages"", just so it's not unnecessarily long.)  I then print that ""pseudo-trace"" anytime mymethod is called.It's important to note also thatis rarely ever enough to debug an issue and it's usually empty.  Take these 2 pseudo-traces for example from one of my failed tests that I'm currently working on.  It has 2 exceptions related to incorrect handling of the case of the header strings.  Only the second exception had anything in:Overall,works sufficiently well and allows me to debug issues as we further develop our code.The Current ProblemThe only issues I now have are just annoying ones:The pseudo-traces definitely have more in them than is really needed.Testing unnecessarily spits out all of the printed exception traces (e.g. when the ultimately raisedis caught and handled, e.g. in a).When you have a lot of tests, it's difficult to match an exception in the summary in each failed test with the printed pseudo-trace somewhere way far back in the terminal window (especially since it also includes printed pseudo-traces from successful tests).QuestionsI have read enough about python traces to know that they are built as the stack is traversed frame-by-frame between where they occur and the catch.  Is there a way to march through that stack without raising, and allowing the script to still proceed, so that I can build a proper traceback on my own?If I don't print the pseudo-trace when the exception is buffered and decide to instead output the group of traces with a raisedexception, is there a way to include those traces with that exception (perhaps organized in some way to make the summary easy to handle)?If I don't do item, is there a way to include a searchable identifier to be able to associate an error string with the pseudo-trace?",5123

However, my benchmarking results show thatoption 2 takes twice as long as option 1 (21s vs. 10s on my system with 32 cores).So,is this behavior kind of as expected? Or are there some inefficiencies about the approach I took?One good thing about option 2 is that it is entirely lazy and it is a preferable approach in a case where we want to have an API which is entirely lazy and return a lazy dataframe and let users determine what to do next.

I have a program that draws the contents of ato a PNG image.  I have found that in some circumstances the PNG image is not being created correctly.  The image generated appears to be 'offset' by some amount, in that the top-left corner of theisn't at (0,0) in the PNG image.The code below demonstrates the problem.  Thefunction creates aof a given width and height, draws at coordinates (0, 0) a solid red rectangle of the same width and height as the scene, renders this scene to an image and writes the image out to a file.  I believe that this function should always write out an image that is solid red, regardless of the width and height it is given.  However,hereis one example output image which demonstrates that this is not the case.Thefunction (which relies onPIL) reads in the image and inspects the rightmost column and bottom row.  If the image has been incorrectly 'offset', it will find a white pixel somewhere within the bottom row or rightmost column.  If the image has been generated correctly, the bottom row and rightmost column will contain only red pixels.  (PIL isn't part of the problem here; I'm just using it to automate the testing of the output images.)Here are a few example runs:$ ./qgraphicssceneimagetest.py 200 200
No red pixels found on bottom row
No red pixels found in rightmost columnIn this case the effect of the 'offsetting' is so drastic that the entire output image is white.$ ./qgraphicssceneimagetest.py 400 400
First red pixel on bottom row is at x = 117
First red pixel in rightmost column is at y = 37This is the case that generated the sample image I linked to above.$ ./qgraphicssceneimagetest.py 500 500
First red pixel on bottom row is at x = 55At this point, the image is now correctly offset vertically, but the red rectangle is still being drawn 55 pixels too far to the right.$ ./qgraphicssceneimagetest.py 600 600
First red pixel on bottom row is at x = 5Nearly correct now...$ ./qgraphicssceneimagetest.py 700 700
Image OKSo it seems that the codecangenerate an output image correctly if the image is large enough.As it happens, I have a workaround for this problem.  I can get thefunction to create the images correctly if I replace the linewithI do not know what the significance of the 'magic' numbers in this code is.  However, I have run numerous tests with this workaround in place and have verified that they all generated a correct solid red image.Having this workaround is all right, but I'd like to understand why these images aren't being created correctly.

I have been learning the calculus behind neural networks and have attempted to implement it using the MNIST database.

In an attempt to debug, I inserted print statements to check if changes were occurring with the weights matrix and if different results are being obtained, and indeed, they were. I initially initialized the weights normally and did not normalize the image values. Subsequently, I normalized them and initialized the weights using the Xavier/Glorot initialization. The cost function employed here is the Mean Squared Error. Despite these adjustments, I find myself stuck and seeking guidance.The above code snippet initializes the layersThe above code defines the model.The provided code initializes a model object, allowing for training and testing.The Cost Values over the epochsreveals a consistent pattern without improvement, even after running the code for approximately 10,000 epochs.What modifications can be implemented to enhance the model's performance?Observing cost fluctuations from the initial epochs, I attempted to find solutions on online forums and consulted Michael Nielsen's Neural Network book without success.
I used ChatGPT as well, as a final measure, but the solutions provided by it was repetitive and did not address the issue, even after implementing suggested changes.

Indeed, it would probably take me less time than to write this question - I more want to know what is considered ""best practice"".  Is it really considered ""best practice"" to duplicate this information both in setup.py and in the library/script?

Many languages that include hashmaps in the standard library or as builtins, allow the programmer to iterate over the hashmap. For example, in python:Or C++:Rust also has a similar thing and the iteration looks more like the python.So my question is: Do the hashmap implementations contain a vector of keys that they can iterate over, and either just give you the key or lookup the value on the fly in O(1)? Or do they go through the actual hash table including empty buckets?I ask because in the latter case, presumably it's more efficient to keep a list of keys myself and iterate that way, rather than actually use the map's functionality.Edit: Perhaps I was unclear in this question. The purpose of a hashmap is to associate keys with values in O(1) time. All of these implementations do that well. But when you want to iterate over all the key/value pairs in your map, there are two different ways I can think of to achieve that. One is to have an array of your keys, go through that array, lookup each key in O(1) time, and print the key/value. This takes O(n) because you havenkeys.The other way is to run a for loop over the hashmap and extract the keys, values, or both. My question is whether this form typically comes with a speed penalty because the hashtable has empty buckets that need to be checked as we iterate. Normally it seems obvious that we should incur this penalty, but I feel like if I were implementing a library like this I would keep an array of keys and when the user requests to iterate I would do it the first way.",458

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77884598/wolves-and-sheep-how-do-i-correctly-check-if-two-lists-are-the-same-in-python,1,0,55,"Wolves and Sheep! How do I correctly check if two lists are the same in python (same elements in same positions, including nested lists)?
I am trying to code a program that will solve the sheep and wolves problem (also known as prisoners and guards problem, missionaries and cannibals problem, etc.).The problem:Three sheep and three wolves must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two animals. At no time can you have the wolves outnumber the sheep on either bank of the river. Additionally, you cannot send the boat across the river without carrying at least one wolf or sheep.Background on my code so far:My code is supposed to take different starting numbers of sheep and wolves and return a solution of how many sheep/wolves to move each turn to solve the problem, or return an empty list if the problem is not solvable.So far, I've created a function that will generate all possible moves (combinations of wolves/sheep to send over to the other bank of the river) regardless of if they are valid or not. I am now working on a function that will iterate through each generated move and determine whether or not the move is valid. The function will return a list containing only the valid moves.My problem:I'm having trouble setting up a condition based on moving only one wolf or sheep. In the starting state of the problem (where all three sheep/wolves are on one bank) there is an option to send either one sheep or one wolf to the other bank. The problem with this move is that it is ultimately unproductive as the only next valid move after this would be to send that sheep or wolf right back (as they would be the only animal on the side with the boat to send back).A move (or state) is formatted as a list of lists. The first list in this list includes three numbers in the following order: number of sheep, number of wolves, boat indicator (1 if the boat is on that side, 0 if it is not on that side). This list represents the left bank of the river. The second list is the exact same and represents the right bank of the river. For example, the starting condition (three sheep, three wolves, and the boat on the left bank) would look like this:If you moved two wolves over to the right bank, the state would look like this:.The unproductive move I described two paragraphs will look like one of the following states:,,,. Condition 4 and 5 below (c4, c5) are how I'm trying to see if the possible state matches this criterial and should be eliminated, however it's not working for me. When I start with an initial state of three wolves, three sheep, and the boat on the left hand bank, I produce the following possible states:The first and third states are invalid/unproductive because the next move in the problem would require sending that wolf/sheep back in the boat returning the problem to the starting state. However, when I run my code, the function I created returns the following states as valid:The first state in this list should be an invalid state. It shows that only one wolf was on the boat traveling from the left bank to the right bank. The only move that can be taken is for that wolf to go back on the boat and return to the left bank thus returning to the starting state.I need help understanding why my conditions (specifically conditions four and five) are not working correctly and why it's including states that I'm trying to define as invalid. I'm not sure if I'm missing something with list comprehension and comparison in Python but I haven't yet been able to figure out what I'm doing wrong.The function I'm using to remove invalid states/identify valid states is below. Condition 4/5 is where I'm having trouble.I've reviewed the conditions I've specified in my formula to ensure they match the list positions of the sheep, wolf, and boat counts. I had previously tried checking for equality against the bad condition (e.g. check if the first list in the state matched [1,0,1] or [0,1,1]) but this didn't eliminate any of the states that matched the criterial. I had to switch to referencing list indexes in order to partially solve the problem, but as you can see I'm still not getting rid of all the states that I want to in order to correctly solve this problem.",1399

Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:Python novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element:. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)Edit:Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments andUtaal's in particular, I elaborated further:To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or ""together"" with it?Doing the binding inside the function would mean thatis effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: theline would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.",274

This question is not for the discussion of whether or not thesingleton design patternis desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.Best methods:Method 1: A decoratorProsDecorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.ConsWhile objects created usingwould be true singleton objects,itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also forthenbutMethod 2: A base classProsIt's a true classConsMultiple inheritance - eugh!could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.Method 3: AmetaclassProsIt's a true classAuto-magically covers inheritanceUsesfor its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)ConsAre there any?Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same nameProsIt's a true classAuto-magically covers inheritanceConsIs there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...What is the point of theattributeCan't call methods of the same name on base classes usingbecause they will recurse. This means you can't customizeand can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to.Method 5: a modulea module fileProsSimple is better than complexConsNot lazily instantiated",1850

The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is oftentupling.Option: Using a tupleConsider this trivial example:However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.Option: Using a dictionaryThe next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a.Consider the following:(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,Option: Using a classHowever, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after alljust end up being entries in the internalof the.There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, theattribute. The class could be expressed as:From thePython Reference Manual:Thedeclaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved becauseis not created for each instance.Option: Using adataclass(Python 3.7+)Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:Option: Using a listAnother suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists aremutable, whereas tuples are not.I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.QuestionAfter the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question.

I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.My first thought is to useto hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structureQuerying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structureUpdating the database after manipulating pieces in pandasReal-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example,.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).",69

I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.Here's aversion that can be loaded withResultsSo I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.Update:I have set up a blog for anyone interestedandI have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements.So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!New update:So after the help I got with my questions regardingpaw detectionandpaw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.Aftertrying the current solution on all my measurementsI came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of theto something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. Butwouldn't let me change the size of the array.Anyone has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?",47

Replace seemed like a better choice (as perHow do I get a value of datetime.today() in Python that is ""timezone aware""?):But as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware.  I'm getting ready to fall back to doctoring the input string to have a timezone before parsing it (I'm using dateutil for parsing, if that matters), but that seems incredibly kludgy.Also, I've tried this in both Python 2.6 and Python 2.7, with the same results.ContextI am writing a parser for some data files. There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator. I've already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format. A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons. While in general, I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone, in this case it seems like the best option.

I've been learning, working, and playing with Python for a year and a half now. As a biologist slowly making the turn to bio-informatics, this language has been at the very core of all the major contributions I have made in the lab. I more or less fell in love with the way Python permits me to express beautiful solutions and also with the semantics of the language that allows such a natural flow from thoughts to workable code.What I would like to know is your answer to a kind of question I have seldom seen in this or other forums.

Some of the people on SO almost seem worthy of worship for their Python prowess, please enlighten us :)The kind of answers I would enjoy (but feel free to surprise the readership :P ), is formatted more or less like this:Read this (eg: python tutorial), pay attention to that kind of detailsCode for so manytime/problems/lines of codeThen, read this (eg: this or that book), but this time, pay attention to thisTackle a few real-life problemsThen, proceed to reading Y.Be sure to grasp these conceptsCode for X timeCome back to such and such basics or move further to...(you get the point :)I really care about knowing your opinion on what exactly one should pay attention to, at various stages, in order to progress CONSTANTLY (with due efforts, of course).

But I'm going to give it a go.The problem with existing questions and answers is that often the question is focused on a nuance that the OP has trouble generalizing in order to use a number of the existing good answers.  However, none of the answers attempt to give a comprehensive explanation (because it's a daunting task). Look at a few examples from myGoogle search:How to pivot a dataframe in Pandas?- Good question and answer.  But the answer only answers the specific question with little explanation.pandas pivot table to data frame- OP is concerned with the output of the pivot, namely how the columns look.  OP wanted it to look like R.  This isn't very helpful for pandas users.pandas pivoting a dataframe, duplicate rows- Another decent question but the answer focuses on one method, namelySetupI conspicuously named my columns and relevant column values to correspond with how I'm going to pivot in the answers below.QuestionsWhy do I get?How do I pivotsuch that thevalues are columns,values are the index, and mean ofare the values?How do I make it so that missing values are?Can I get something other than, like maybe?Can I do more that one aggregation at a time?Can I aggregate over multiple value columns?Can I subdivide by multiple columns?OrCan I aggregate the frequency in which the column and rows occur together, aka ""cross tabulation""?How do I convert a DataFrame from long to wide by pivoting on ONLY two columns?

The critical piece of this is that if the person is counted as Hispanic they can't be counted as anything else.  Even if they have a ""1"" in another ethnicity column they still are counted as Hispanic not two or more races.  Similarly, if the sum of all the ERI columns is greater than 1 they are counted as two or more races and can't be counted as a unique ethnicity(except for Hispanic).It's almost like doing a for loop through each row and if each record meets a criterion they are added to one list and eliminated from the original.From the dataframe below I need to calculate a new column based on the following spec in SQL:CRITERIAComment: If the ERI Flag for Hispanic is True (1), the employee is classified as “Hispanic”Comment: If more than 1 non-Hispanic ERI Flag is true, return “Two or More”DATAFRAME",1996

Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:Python novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element:. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)Edit:Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments andUtaal's in particular, I elaborated further:To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or ""together"" with it?Doing the binding inside the function would mean thatis effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: theline would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.",274

For each of these numbers afunction is created which capturesand adds it to the function's input. The last line calls the secondfunction withas a parameter.

When creating theclosures for, I expected it to store a pointer to the integer object currently pointed to by. That means that whenassigned a new integer object it shouldn't effect the previously created closures. Sadly, inspecting thearray within a debugger shows that it does. Allfunctions refer to the last value of,, which results inreturning.Which make me wonder about the following:What do the closures capture exactly?What is the most elegant way to convince thefunctions to capture the current value ofin a way that will not be affected whenchanges its value?For a more accessible, practical version of the question, specific to the case where a loop (or list comprehension, generator expression etc.) is used, seeCreating functions (or lambdas) in a loop (or comprehension).

This question is not for the discussion of whether or not thesingleton design patternis desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.Best methods:Method 1: A decoratorProsDecorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.ConsWhile objects created usingwould be true singleton objects,itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also forthenbutMethod 2: A base classProsIt's a true classConsMultiple inheritance - eugh!could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.Method 3: AmetaclassProsIt's a true classAuto-magically covers inheritanceUsesfor its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)ConsAre there any?Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same nameProsIt's a true classAuto-magically covers inheritanceConsIs there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...What is the point of theattributeCan't call methods of the same name on base classes usingbecause they will recurse. This means you can't customizeand can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to.Method 5: a modulea module fileProsSimple is better than complexConsNot lazily instantiated",1850

In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a.Consider the following:(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers.

The solution is to bindas an argument to, using one of the techniques described here.

Similarly, if the sum of all the ERI columns is greater than 1 they are counted as two or more races and can't be counted as a unique ethnicity(except for Hispanic).It's almost like doing a for loop through each row and if each record meets a criterion they are added to one list and eliminated from the original.From the dataframe below I need to calculate a new column based on the following spec in SQL:CRITERIAComment: If the ERI Flag for Hispanic is True (1), the employee is classified as “Hispanic”Comment: If more than 1 non-Hispanic ERI Flag is true, return “Two or More”DATAFRAME",1996

Also,some functions will depend on other columns in the groupby object(like sumif functions).

I am sorry that I can't reproduce the error with a simpler example, and my code is too complicated to post. If I run the program in IPython shell instead of the regular Python, things work out well.I looked up some previous notes on this problem.

But this is not the case for me.I would appreciate any help.Update: The function I pickle is defined at the top level of the module. Though it calls a function that contains a nested function. i.e,callscallswhich has a nested function, and I am calling.,,are all defined at the top level.
